# Image Classification Project
This repository contains the code I wrote for Coursera's image classification guided project.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create, train, and evaluate a neural network model that, after the training, becomes able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy.


## Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras


## Usage
To use this code, you will need to have Python, TensorFlow, and Keras installed. You can clone this repository and run the train.py script to train the model on your own dataset.

## Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience, and I gained valuable skills and knowledge in neural networks and image classification. I hope this code can serve as a useful resource for others interested in this field.
